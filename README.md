## Project Setup

Up environment:

`make start`

Execute tests:

`make phpunit`

Static code analysis:

`make style`

Enter in php container:

`make s=php sh`

Disable\Enable Xdebug:

`make xoff`

`make xon`

## PHPStorm integration

PHPSTORM has native integration with Docker compose. That's nice but will stop your php container after run the test scenario. That's not nice when using fpm. A solution could be use another container just for that purpose. But I don't want. For that reason I use ssh connection. Note that ssh in the cntainer it's ONLY for that reason, if you've ssh installed in your production container, you're doing it wrong... 

Use ssh remote connection.
